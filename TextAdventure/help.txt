they cannot attack you or do anything to you until you've used your moves up.

* You will only use up a move when the action is successful except for when harvesting.
* Viewing your inventory and any commands which do not move the player or afffect the world do not take up moves.



Leveling

By completing actions in the world, you will gain XP. XP is then divided up into levels. Having a high level gives benefits 
such as less stanima degradation and less of a need to eat. You also do more damage to opponents. 

+ Having a high level lets you eat less.
+ You attack enemies with more damage.
+ You use less stanima.
+ You are really awesome.


The World

Closed doors can be denoted by a capital D and can be opened using a key. Keys can be aquired by conquring rooms
as well as trading and finding them naturally or crafting them. You can also find helpful items such as food and healing items in rooms, 
but these items are guarded by goblins.

Your hunger, stanima, health and Mana bars can be found at the top of the window. Your hunger will decrease over time
and when it hits zero, your health will start to decrease. Leveling up can make this happen slower. Your stanima will
increase every round. Leveling up can make this happen faster.

* Keeep an eye on your hunger! if it ever reaches zero you will start losing health.


Inventory

Your inventory is infinite in every possible way. It can store as many items as you like and there are no item limit caps. Items
can be used for benefits such as food, stanima or XP. Some items are special and cannot be used with the use command.

* Golden Apples are the best healing/stanima item in the game.
