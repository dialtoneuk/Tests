structures are simply parsed line by line by the game
each number on the line references the int code of a block

the block int codes are as follows

WALL_INSVISIBLE = 0
DOOR_CLOSED = 1
DEEP_WATER = 2
WALL_SOLID_HORIZONTAL = 3
WALL_SOLID_VERTICAL = 4
WOOD = 5
WALL_SOLID = 6
DOOR_OPEN = 7
WATER = 8
FLOOR = 9
GRASS = 10
SAND = 11
DIRT = 12
MOUNTAIN_GRASS = 13,
STONE = 14,
SNOW = 15

you might have noticed that since each character on the line references the x coord
of the sturcture and everyline is the Y, we cannot have more than one character occupying
that space. I have implemented special character which will allow you to access higher numbers. Simply
put them before the number like demonstrated below

_0_0_0_0_0
*4*4*4*4*4
_0_0_0_0_0

_ = blank character meant for improved readability

*/+/^ = 10 and up
~ = 20 and up
. = 30 and up
` = 40 and up
